+ ## Development
### Issues:

* Animation
* Image positioning
* Audio

##### Animation:

A couple of issues where present when trying the form animate the intro scene of the duck.

With the sprite sheet for the dog not containing an consistent height and pixel pixel.

Overcame by running the aninmation with a iteration of 1.9 and while slightly cropping the image.

```css
#dog {
  position: absolute;
  background: url('images/dogwalk.png');
  top: 520px;
  width: 182px;
  height: 171px;
  animation: walk 2s steps(5) 1.9, dogMove 3.8s linear;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

@keyframes walk {
  0% {
    background-position: 910px;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 0px;
  }
}

@keyframes dogMove {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(-100px);
  }
  10% {
    transform: translateX(-100px);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(300px);
    overflow: hidden;
  } 
}

```

Including these lines of code allowed for a smooth animation for the walking across the screen

##### Image Positioning:

Initial ideas were to position the ducks behind the background.However this posed many problems with an expected solution of the css function

```
z-index: -1;

```
not solving the problem.

Instead requiring and overlay of the grass.png on top of the backgroun image. This was succesfully achieved with the css:

```css
body:after {
display:inline-block;
padding-bottom: 10px;
content: '';
background-image: url('images/grass.png');
background-size: cover;
position: absolute;
bottom: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 175px;
```

##### Audio:

With the limitations of Chrome implementing audio on loadup was particularly difficult. Chrome has an autoplay prevention feature.Therefore setting background music required using the

```jQuery
setTimeOut(function,time(ms));
```

```js
  var title = $('#titlesound');
  function timer(){
    var sec = 80;
    var timerCountdown = setInterval(function(){
      // console.log(sec);
      sec--;
      if (sec == 79) {
        title[0].play();
      }}, 100);
    }
  timer();
```	

With this a timer is created that	 runs a function that plays the audio if the timer meets a condition e.g. after 1 second.

##### Bugs:
Some bugs are still present in the current build of the game.

Examples of this would be the dog laughing event added with the shot is missed twice. If the player were to miss again i.e. click on the page where a duck is not present then the event will automatically end without fully loaded the animation.

Another potential bug is the time delay in the audio when a shot is fired.There is currently a delay of 1s therefore two proceding shots wont sound one after the other instead the sound play again on the 4 shot.

These are future task that could be completed to improve the functionality of the game.

##### Potential Features:
Potential features could be adding more events for the bird flying animations and interations with the dog.

Also including an interface that counts the animation and limits how many the user has.
